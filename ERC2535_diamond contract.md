📒 What is Diamond Smart Contracts (ERC 2535) 📒

🤯 Developing a secured production-ready smart contract is challenging and being immutable in nature, it makes it even harder.

🤔 Here comes ERC 2535 to save us. It provides some flexibility for crypto innovators.

🧠 ERC 2535 is called a diamond upgradable proxy contract primarily offers
1️⃣ Upgradability
2️⃣ Flexibility
3️⃣ Modularity

⚡ Diamond contract is termed a multi-facet proxy contract which consists of multiple facets (Implementation contracts).
⚡ Developers can utilize the facets to modularize the contract logic into individual facets as needed.
⚡ Individual facets can be upgraded independently which makes the contract versioning and maintenance easier.
⚡ No more limitations in the contract size, we can modularize the diamond contract as per our needs.
⚡ Developers can remove the upgradeable nature of the contract as desired.
⚡ Diamond contract will track the update history which makes it convenient to track the changes.
⚡ No more storage collisions or incompatible upgradability limitations
⚡ Different storage patterns to deal with (App Storage, Diamond Storage)

Diamond proxy contracts are a lifesaver for many solidity developers and it is really powerful. Many big players are already using the diamond contracts

😎 Example projects:
1️⃣ Aavegotchi
2️⃣ Moonstream DAO
3️⃣ OP Games
4️⃣ Louper & so on

🤩 Upgradability is a concern for a few projects and tends to go with immutable contracts. The diamond contract is capable of removing its upgradability in a safe manner which is really flexible.
🤑 Projects can go with upgradability at the initial phase and get feedback from the community and go through required upgrades as needed. Once the project is mature enough, the upgradability can be removed.
