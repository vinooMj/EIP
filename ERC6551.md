ERC-6551 is a proposal to give every NFT (ERC-721) a smart contract account, which would enable an NFT to interact with the blockchain, 
record its transaction history, and own ERC-20, 721, and 1155 tokens.

Colloquially known as a “token-bound account,” ERC-6551 would be natively compatible with existing Ethereum standards. Ownership would be
delegated to the owner of the NFT, essentially making it an NFT with an attached on-chain wallet—commonly referred to as a “backpack wallet.”

This unlocks a host of opportunities:

• PFP NFTs with an embedded DAO voting history, asset ownership records, and an ENS sub-domain name, creating a more substantive 
on-chain identity. 
• NFT-based Web3 gaming characters that can store skins, weapons, and prizes in their backpack wallet. 
• A simple way for DeFi protocols to provide users with ownership over a wide variety of tokenized assets through the purchase 
of a single NFT.

While ERC-6551 is not yet an official standard, it reflects the ongoing innovation in NFTs and the current push to improve the Web3 UX.
