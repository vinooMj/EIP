ERC-4337 is an Ethereum standard that achieves account abstraction on the protocol without any consensus-layer changes. It was proposed by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and other developers in 2021 and was deployed 
on the Ethereum mainnet in March 2023.

Account abstraction is the ability to combine the features of two existing account types in Ethereum: Externally owned accounts (EOA) and smart contract accounts.
EOAs are controlled by private keys, while smart contract accounts are controlled by code. ERC-4337 allows for a single contract account that can both transact with tokens 
and create contracts.

This change makes creative wallet designs such as social recovery, customization, and upgradeability possible. Social recovery allows users to recover their wallets even 
if they lose their private keys. Customization allows users to choose the features and functionality of their wallets. Upgradeability allows wallets to be updated with new 
features and security improvements without having to create a new wallet.

ERC-4337 works by introducing a new type of transaction called a UserOperation. UserOperations are pseudo-transactions that are sent to a dedicated user operation mempool.
Bundlers then collect these UserOperations and package them into a single transaction that is sent to the Ethereum network.

The ERC-4337 standard is still under development, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way that Ethereum wallets are designed and used. By allowing for a single
contract account that can both transact with tokens and create contracts, ERC-4337 makes it possible to create more user-friendly and secure wallets.

Here are some of the benefits of ERC-4337:

Account abstraction: ERC-4337 allows for a single contract account that can both transact with tokens and create contracts. This makes it possible to create more user-friendly and 
secure wallets.
Social recovery: ERC-4337 supports social recovery, which allows users to recover their wallets even if they lose their private keys.
Customization: ERC-4337 allows users to customize their wallets with different features and functionality.
Upgradeability: ERC-4337 makes it possible to upgrade wallets with new features and security improvements without having to create a new wallet.
Overall, ERC-4337 is a promising standard that has the potential to revolutionize the way that Ethereum wallets are designed and used. It is still under development, 
but it has already been adopted by a number of wallets and projects.
